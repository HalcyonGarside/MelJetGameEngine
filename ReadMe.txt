A custom game engine by William Blanchard

This game engine is being created as an ongoing exercise in computer graphics
software development, a field I am very curious about and wish to pursue.  I 
have no plans to develop the project beyond the very simple goal of being able
to develop a simple 3D game with it.

With MelJet, I wish to explore multiple topics, including, but not limited to:

- Linear algebra and its uses in 3 dimensional space
- The structure of professional graphics programs by referencing open source 
  engines such as Gadot and Blender
- OpenGL and DirectX, and which of those libraries I personally prefer

I have no planned end date, but I do have a dynamic list of milestones that 
will change the more I learn about what I am doing.  I believe this will keep
me motivated and focused on my ultimate end goal.  

Finally, I plan to begin a blog documenting my trials and tribulations
regarding MelJet.  Though not open just yet, my venture into this topic
will evidently not be an easy one, and I want all of my issues to be documented
for people who want to follow a similar path.  This will include any
communications I have with those more experienced than me and any resources 
available to the public that I use in development.

[Again, I have not set the blog up yet, but if I had, the link would go here]

If you have any tips or tricks you'd like to offer, or if you want to contact
me for any other reason, please shoot me an e-mail at wil.s.blanchard@gmail.com.
I would be happy to respond and share a nice chat!

Milestones:

Build a functioning renderer [ ]

Find a way to import different 3D models [ ]

Create or find an acceptable UI library [ ]

Mash the renderer and the UI together in a way that allows a user to develop
a game [ ]

Practice Labs:
In addition to the development of this engine, I am on the hunt for practice 
exercises.  For these, I will post the sources from which I found them.  Each
source link is labelled with the name of the folder it corresponds to, and is
accompanied with a short description as needed.

This website is from a professor named David Eck from the Hobart and William
Smith Colleges.  He occasionally teaches a graphics course there and posts
the resources on this website, everything between the textbook he uses (and 
has written) to the hands-on material he assigns to his students.  This folder 
contains all of the labs that I have used as practice from the link above.
